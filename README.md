# Conversions

I wanted to take the algorithms learned in my Discrete math class and apply them using my favorite programming language, Rust. I'll continue to update this throughout the course, listing each algorithm implemented.

To run a specified algorithm, enter `cargo run -p <program name>` into the console.

## Algorithms Currently Implemented

- ### Euclidean
  - Basic Algorithm
